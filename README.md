## [ex00](./ex00) - Bye C, Hi C++!
A simple getting started C++ program that converts all provided arguments to uppercase and prints them.

## [ex01](./ex01) - My Tiny Phonebook
Implementation of a simple phonebook program with two classes: `PhoneBook` (stores up to 8 contacts, replacing the oldest when adding a 9th) and `Contact` (represents individual contact details).

The program supports three commands: `ADD` (to input new contacts), `SEARCH` (to display contact details in a formatted table), and `EXIT` (to quit the program). It also handles EOF user input gracefully (Ctrl + D).

## [ex02](./ex02)  - Reconstruct C++ Program
Recreating the missing `Account.cpp` file for a C++ project, using the remaining `Account.hpp` header and the provided log file (`19920104_091532.log`) to reconstruct the original implementation of bank account creation, deposit and withdrawal processing, and account closure.    

The goal is to write code that compiles and matches the expected behavior, as validated by running `tests.cpp` and comparing the output to the provided log file.
