Recreating a missing `Account.cpp` file for a C++ project, using the remaining `Account.hpp` header and a provided log file (`19920104_091532.log`) to reconstruct the original implementationimplementation of bank account creation, deposit and withdrawal processing, and account closure.    

The goal is to write code that compiles and matches the expected behavior, as validated by running `tests.cpp` and comparing the output to the provided log file.
